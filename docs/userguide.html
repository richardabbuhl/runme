<h1>User Guide for RunMe</h1>
<p>This document describes how to install and use the RunMe client-server application.</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>RunMe is an application that allows Customer Service Representatives (CSRs) to book (or un-book) one or more contractors for a customer. &nbsp;It includes a server that supports access to a legacy data file that is currently being used by the company's IT department and it allows CSRs to modify this data using a GUI that uses a client-server architecture for communication with the server.</p>
<h2>Pre-Installation Requirements</h2>
<p>RunMe is supported on any platform that supports the Java (TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition. &nbsp;Please install JRE 1.4.2_06 or later before beginning the installation process.</p>
<h3>Space Requirements</h3>
<p>RunMe requires at least 1GByte of disk space for the server and 30KB of disk space for the client.</p>



<h3>Network Requirements</h3>
<p>In order to service client requests, the server that hosts&nbsp;the RunMe server application needs to allow connections through port 1099.</p>
<h2>Server Installation</h2>
<p>The server installation requires copying the RunMe server executable and database to the server. &nbsp;The server excutable is called runme.jar and the datafile is db-2x2.db. &nbsp;It is recommended to create a directory called runme and to copy these two files to that directory on the server system.</p>
<h2>Starting the Server in Stand-Alone Mode</h2>
<p>To verify the server is correctly installed, it is possible to start the server in stand-alone mode. &nbsp;In stand-alone mode, the client and server will be started and it will be possible to verify that the database file can be accessed. &nbsp;Use the following command to start the server in stand-alone mode:</p>
<p>java -jar runme.jar alone</p>
<p>You should see the GUI and can press the Search button to see records in the database using a local connection to the server.</p>

<p>You can also change the location of the legacy database file&nbsp;that&nbsp;accessed by the server by selecting the File/Options menu item. &nbsp;You will be shown a dialog box that contains the current location. &nbsp;Enter the new location and press the OK button. &nbsp;You can check that the database is found by pressing the Search button again.</p>

<h2>Starting the Server in Server Mode</h2>
<p>Once the server if verified to be correctly installed, it is possible to start the server in server mode. &nbsp;In this mode, the server will be started and it will be possible for clients to connect to the server in order. &nbsp;Use the following command:</p>
<p>java -jar runme.jar server</p>
<h2>Stopping the Server</h2>
<p>Once the server is running, it is possible to stop the server by pressing Control-C in the window where the server is running.</p>
<h2>Client Installation</h2>
<p>The client installation requires copying the RunMe client executable to the client's system. &nbsp;The client excutable is called runme.jar and is the same executable that is used on the server. &nbsp;It is recommended to create a directory called runme and to copy this files to that directory on the client's system.</p>
<h2>Starting the Client in Client Mode</h2>
<p>After the client is installed, it is possible to start the client in client mode. &nbsp;Use the following command</p>
<p>java -jar runme.jar</p>
<p>You should see the GUI and are ready to configure the client so that it is possible to connect to the server.</p>

<h2>Configuring the Server Connection in Client Mode</h2>
<p>After the client is installed and the GUI has been started, it is possible to configure the client so that it is possible to connect to the server. &nbsp;You can change the server IP address by selecting the File/Options menu item. &nbsp;You will be shown a dialog box that contains the current server IP address (the default is localhost).</p>
<p><img src="images/img4.gif" border="0"></p>
<p>Enter the IP address where the server is installed and press the OK button. &nbsp;You can check that the server was found by pressing the Search button on the GUI.</p>
<h2>Using the Search Button to find a SubContractor</h2>

Overview

This files describes the significant design choices I made during development of this project. It details the problems
I perceived, the issues surrounding them, my value judgments, and the decisions that I made to resolve these issues.
This document should also describe any uncertainties I had regarding the project, and the decisions I made when
resolving them.

Database Issues

I was not sure how to access the records in the file.  By default, I choose the DataAccessStream but it does not allow
seeking within the file.  Instead, I choose RandomAccessFile since seeks are necessary to read/write files.

For performance reasons, I seemed necessary to cache the schema.  So, I created a Schema class and the schema is read
and in saved so it can be used when future database accesses are requested.

To lock the database, I choose to use a HashMap for holding the locking information.

GUI Issues

For the GUI, a simple approach was chosen so that search, modify, and deletes were allowed.


RMI Implementation

Change:  However, sockets require the client and server to engage in applications-level protocols to encode and decode messages for exchange, and the design of such protocols is cumbersome and can be error-prone.

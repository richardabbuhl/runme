User documentation for the database server and the gui client. If your user documentation is online then you may omit this file. 
However, if the documentation is not online, you must provide either a single plain ASCII (not word processor format) text document,
which must be called userguide.txt, or multiple HTML files which must all be accessible from a starting point document that must be
called userguide.html.
